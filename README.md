FrameAnimation is a powerful library for displaying frame animation in Android applications.

### *Requirements*

FrameAnimation can be included in any Android application.

FrameAnimation supports Android 4.0 and later.

### *Using FrameAnimation in your application*

If you are building with Gradle, simply add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:

### *Attention Please*

FrameAnimation now longer has a direct dependency on the Android Support library. Instead, it expects certain part of the support library to be provided by the including application. If you do not include the Android Support Library yourself already, you will have to add the following line to your build.gradle file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0-rc02'
```
